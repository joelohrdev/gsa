            <p>The Green Stone Artisans’ story begins in 2007. Mike & Lori Askew were thriving in their chosen professions (construction and dentistry respectively). The quintessential American couple with two daughters; Even a picket fence that surrounded the home they built together.</p>
            <p>It was August of that year when their lives would change.</p>
            <p>By winter 2008, the American financial market was in a full-blown recession. And the recession left the Askew family in dire straits. </p>
            <p>Once the initial panic, shock, and chaos subsided, Mike and Lori, both artistic in their own right, saw an opportunity. An opportunity to take control of their own future. Their self-motivation was coupled with motivation bestowed upon them by their daughters.</p>
            <p>They married their passion for the arts with the sophistication of concrete. Their varied movements as Mike manipulated the stone and Lori the acrylic paints became two artistic signatures on the surface of each piece, as their movement made the composition unequaled to any other.</p>
            <p>The fusion of mediums was a coupled by the collaboration of two artisans. A partnership. A marriage. Led by the love for the craft and for each other. It was then that Lori’s abstract acrylic painting was framed by the lightweight concrete crafted by Mike. Each media and artisan melding together as one. It was picture-perfect. It was the beginning of Green Stone Artisans.</p>
